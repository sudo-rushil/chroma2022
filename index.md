## Harvard-MIT Homotopy Theory Seminar Summer 2022

### Introduction to Stable and Chromatic Homotopy Theory

<b>Overview:</b>

Chroma is a joint Harvard-MIT summer seminar primarily focused at undergraduates interested in algebraic topology and homotopy theory. If you're an undergraduate or graduate student and are interested in these subjects, fill out the interest form in the top-right!

This summer, subject to the interests of the participants, we will try to define the stable homotopy category, understand its desirable properties for computational and abstract homotopy theory, and present some results from chromatic homotopy theory. Roughly, we will follow Ravenal's [Nilpotence and Periodicity in Stable Homotopy Theory](https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/mybooks/nilpb2020.pdf), but will spend some time reviewing preliminaries to this book. The goal is to develop an intuituion and appreciation for the machinery of stable homotopy theory without getting bogged down by technicalities and computation.

Ideally, familiarity with algebraic topology at the level of Hatcher chapters 1-4 (_sans_ the additional sections) will be helpful, but everyone is welcome to participate!

Tentatively, we will meet once a week on Zoom from early June to late August. Each meeting will consist of a talk given by one of the participants, followed by a question/discussion session. As we're in the early stages of organizing, the dates and times will be shifted to be accomodating of everyone!
