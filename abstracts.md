## Talk Abstracts

<b>June 2: <i>Introduction to this Summer's Topics</i>, Dora Woodruff</b>

In my talk, I'll mostly be giving an introduction to this summer's topics. We'll start by going over some starting definitions and relevant theorems, such as the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, to make sure we're all on the same page and to motivate the idea of stable homotopy. I'll then try to give some intuition as to what the stable homotopy category is and why it's natural and helpful to use it. Finally, I'll discuss the Nilpotence Theorem, including its various different formulations and an application. Hopefully, there will be a good amount of time for questions and discussion.
